# Simple 15 minute blog

Created for IMD Year 2 in order to show how good Rails is. 

The following files were the ones I changed beyond using the scaffold generators:

* app/views/posts/index.html.erb
* app/views/posts/show.html.erb
* app/views/comments/_form.html.erb
* app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
* app/controllers/posts_controller.rb
* app/controllers/comments_controller.rb

Any questions fire me an email - hi@tommyp.org
